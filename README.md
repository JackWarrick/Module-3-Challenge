# Module-3-Challenge
Random Password Generator

# Description
This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT files for a program that genertes a random password using criteria decided by the user - length, whether or not to include uppercase letters, whether or not to include lowercase letters, whether or not to include numbers, and whether or not to include special characters. When the user clicks the button, the user is presented with a series of prompts to choose the criteria. The user must choose a length of at least 8 and at most 128, and the user must click "OK" to at least one of the prompts asking for type of characters to include. The user will get a confirmation alert after each choice. After the prompts, the password is generated to match the criteria, and it is displayed on the page.
